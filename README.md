## Module 1 

### Sprint 1

#### Project
In this part I created [Chess Capture Analysis Tool](https://github.com/justsvykas/Chess_analysis_tool). It is a Python-based project designed to analyze chess positions and determine which black pieces a single white piece can capture. It has been since reviewed and graded.
