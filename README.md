# Turing_College

Here I keep track of some repo's and folders associated in my journey with TC.

# Module 1 

## Sprint 1

### Project
In this part I created [Chess Capture Analysis Tool](https://github.com/justsvykas/Turing_College/tree/main/module_1/sprint_1/part_6/project). It is a Python-based project designed to analyze chess positions and determine which black pieces a single white piece can capture. It has been since reviewed and graded.

## Sprint 2

### Part 2
In this part I experimented with Git during which I created repository [Kevin Cookie Factory](https://github.com/justsvykas/KevinCookieCompany) in which I played around with Git locally and then created cloud repository in Github.

### Part 4
In this part we are required to solve some of [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) exercises. I dont like coding enviroment in HackerRank website so for more hard exercises I code locally and then paste the code there. Given the opportunity I decided to practice my git skills and also push the code in this repository. The exercises which I solved locally are as follows:

- [Matrix Script](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/matrix-script/problem). My solution is [here](https://github.com/justsvykas/Turing_College/tree/main/module_1/sprint_2/part_4/matrix_script)
- [Validating UID](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/validating-uid/problem). My solution is [here](https://github.com/justsvykas/Turing_College/tree/main/module_1/sprint_2/part_4/validating_UID)
- [Piling Up]. My solution is [here](https://github.com/justsvykas/Turing_College/tree/main/module_1/sprint_2/part_4/piling_up)
